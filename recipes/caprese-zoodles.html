        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) basket cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>5 medium zucchini, run through a spiralizer</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container mini mozzarella balls, halved</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh basil, cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons balsamic glaze</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add cherry tomatoes and quickly stir until tomatoes just begin to soften, 1 to 2 minutes. Add zucchini noodles, salt, and pepper. Keep cooking, stirring frequently, until zoodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and stir in mozzarella and basil. Toss to coat. Divide zoodles between 4 bowls and drizzle with balsamic glaze. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Cook's Notes</h2>
        <p>Zoodles do not reheat well and become watery the longer they sit. Eat immediately</p>
