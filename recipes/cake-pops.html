        <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
        <p>Any flavor cake mix can be used in place of the yellow cake mix.</p>
        <p>You can use different food colorings for the chocolate. White chocolate bark can be used in place of the chocolate bark, if desired. Add a drop of red food coloring for a pink coating.</p>
        <h2>Editor's Note:</h2>
